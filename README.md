Hello, my name is Max. I'm passionate about IT, technology, and programming.
I believe that sooner or later, coding will become a basic skill â€” just like reading.
That's why I'm learning Python and building my journey here on GitHub.

ðŸ”­ Currently learning: Python, Git, Open Source  
ðŸŒ± Exploring: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Linux tools
